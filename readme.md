## About

Are you fed up of the &lsquo;doom and gloom&rsquo; that is so prolific in our daily news? Make your day a happier one with Pository &reg;: An Internet negativity filter (delivered via bookmarklet), that determines if an online article is worth reading (or not).

Test it at [pository.scott.ee](http://pository.scott.ee).

## Installation

Requirements are PHP/MySQL/Apache. You will need to create a new database and import db.sql into it. Once you have done that add your database and domain configuration to includes/class.config.php. It is clearly labelled. The code is configured to run from its current URL (pository.scott.ee). It appears a handful of times (class.config.php, index.php, pository.js) throughout the code so a search and replace will need to be performed.
